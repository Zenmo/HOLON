# Specify the ETM keys of what to retrieve from the ETM and put in the models input folder.
# You can add conversions based on other ETM data to the items.
# The name of the item is how it will be named in the output folder:
#
# <ITEM_NAME>:
#   value:                The main value on which conversions will be done
#     type:               Which type of ETM request is needed. Right now only 'query' and
#                         'node_property' are supported. In the future the curves endpoint
#                         can be added as well.
#     data:               What data to look for / expect. For queries this can be either
#                         'value' or 'curve'. For node properties you can specify which
#                         property of the node is needed. The path to the property should be
#                         separated by dots ('.'), for example:
#                         technical.electricity_output_conversion.future
#     etm_key:            The key of the query to send to the ETM, or the name of the node
#   conversion:           If a conversion is nesccesary, please specify. Currently only 'divide'
#                         is supported.
#   convert_with_value:   When conversion is set, specify with which ETM value the item should be
#                         converted with. E.g for 'divide' this is the value to be divided by.
#                         This value has the same properties as the main 'value' field.
